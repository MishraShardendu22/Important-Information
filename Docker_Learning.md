## What is a Docker ?

### Docker is a platform that lets you package an application and its dependencies into a "container," which can run consistently on any system. 
### Think of it like a virtual box that has everything the app needs to run, so no matter where you put the box (your laptop, a server, etc.), the app works the same way.
