## Prefix Sum in Subarray Problems:

Works well because subarrays are contiguous, and prefix sums rely on consecutive elements to calculate sums efficiently.
Subsequence Problems:

Prefix sum cannot be used directly since subsequences are not contiguous, and their sums require different approaches (e.g., dynamic programming or recursion).
In short: Prefix Sum = Subarray problems, Not Subsequence problems.
