## Vidkarya Error Fix

1. Autoprefixer: end value has mixed support
Reason: Autoprefixer, which adds vendor prefixes for CSS rules, is warning you that end in justify-content (e.g., justify-content: end;) is not fully supported across all browsers.

Solution: Replace justify-content: end; with justify-content: flex-end;, which has broader browser support.
