## What is canary ?

In the context of **Next.js**, the term **canary** usually refers to a pre-release or experimental version of the framework that contains the latest features and updates under active development. These canary versions are published to allow developers to test and provide feedback on upcoming changes before they are officially released in a stable version.

Here are some key details about canary versions:

### **Why Canary Versions Exist**
1. **Early Access**: Canary versions provide access to the latest features and experimental updates.
2. **Community Feedback**: Developers can try out new functionality and report bugs or provide feedback, helping the Next.js team refine the final release.
3. **Bug Identification**: Bugs and issues can be identified and resolved before the stable version is released.

### **How to Install a Canary Version**
To install a canary version of Next.js, you can specify it when installing the package using npm, yarn, or pnpm:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install next@canary

# Using yarn
yarn add next@canary

# Using pnpm
pnpm add next@canary
```

### **Should You Use a Canary Version?**
- **Use It If:**
  - You are experimenting or want to stay ahead of new features.
  - You can handle possible bugs or breaking changes.
  - You want to contribute by providing feedback or bug reports.
  
- **Avoid It If:**
  - You need a stable and reliable environment for production.
