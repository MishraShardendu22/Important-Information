You can achieve similar results with both `GET` and `POST` requests, but they are designed for different purposes and have some key differences:

1. **Purpose:**
   - `GET`: Used for retrieving data from the server without changing its state. It is **idempotent**, meaning calling it multiple times should give the same result and have no side effects.
   - `POST`: Used to send data to the server (e.g., form submissions), which may result in changes on the server. It is **non-idempotent**, meaning each request could result in a different state.

2. **Data Transmission:**
   - `GET`: Data is sent as part of the **URL** (query parameters), making it visible in the browser’s address bar. This limits the amount of data you can send (about 2000 characters, though this can vary).
   - `POST`: Data is sent in the **body** of the request, allowing for larger data transfers and making it more secure, as the data is not exposed in the URL.

3. **Caching:**
   - `GET`: Responses are usually **cached** by default by browsers and intermediate servers.
   - `POST`: Responses are generally **not cached**.

4. **Security:**
   - `GET`: Less secure because parameters are visible in the URL. Shouldn’t be used to send sensitive data (e.g., passwords).
   - `POST`: Safer for transmitting sensitive data because it’s in the request body, not the URL.

### Conclusion:
You can technically use `POST` to fetch data (which is what `GET` is usually for), but you lose the efficiency, idempotency, and caching benefits that `GET` offers. Similarly, you shouldn't use `GET` for actions that modify data on the server.
