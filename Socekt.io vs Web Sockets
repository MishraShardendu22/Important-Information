# WebSocket vs. Socket.IO

## WebSocket

- **What it is**: A way for web browsers and servers to talk to each other in real time.
- **Standard**: It's part of the HTML5 specification.
- **Browser Support**: Works on most modern browsers.
- **Connection**: Uses only WebSocket for communication.
- **API**: Has a simple interface to send and receive messages.
- **Reconnection**: Doesnâ€™t reconnect automatically; you have to code it.
- **Data Format**: Can send text and binary data.
- **When to use**: Great for chat apps, live notifications, and games.

## Socket.IO

- **What it is**: A library that makes using WebSocket easier and better.
- **Standard**: Not a standard; it builds on WebSocket.
- **Browser Support**: Works with different methods if WebSocket isn't available.
- **Connection**: Can use other methods if WebSocket fails.
- **API**: Has a lot of extra features, like rooms and namespaces.
- **Reconnection**: Automatically reconnects if the connection drops.
- **Data Format**: Works well with JSON, making it easy to send complex data.
- **When to use**: Good for real-time apps needing extra features, like chat and collaboration tools.
