RSS, or **Really Simple Syndication**, is a way to get updates from websites without needing to visit them manually. It’s like subscribing to a magazine, but for online content.

Here’s how it works:

1. **RSS Feeds**: Websites create special files called *RSS feeds*. These feeds list the site’s latest updates—articles, news, blog posts, or videos. Each feed item has a title, link, and description.

2. **RSS Reader**: You use an *RSS reader* app or website to subscribe to feeds you like. When those sites publish something new, it appears in your RSS reader. This saves you from having to check each website individually.

3. **Automatic Updates**: The RSS reader regularly checks for updates and shows them to you in one place. So, you always see the latest content from your favorite sites in a single feed.

### Why It’s Useful
RSS is great for following multiple sites easily and never missing updates. You just subscribe to their feeds, and the updates come to you.
